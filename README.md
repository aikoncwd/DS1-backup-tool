So I decided to finish and publish my tool to *automatic backup your DARKSOULS savegame files*. Its easy to use:  

# Installation
- Download and decompress the script anywhere, your Desktop for example
- Open the script with any text editor (notepad, sublimetext, etc...)
- You will see, at the very top of the file, some variables you must edit, you need to specify your current SAVEGAME-DIRECTORY (mine is located in the **Documents folder**, under the **NBGI** sub-folder)
- You can also edit how many backup files do you want to hold, and the time between the tool will make a new backup (current every 3 minutes and 25 backups)
- Save the file and execute it!

# More info
- If the game is not running, the script will auto-launch darksouls, will wait 30 seconds before it starts to make backups.
- You can check if the script is running because you will find new/additional savegames in your SAVEGAME-DIRECTORY (like in the image of this readme)
- After you exit or close DARKSOULS, the script will terminate its execution

# I got hacked but I have Backups
- Close DARKSOULS as fast as you can after you got hacked
- Go to your SAVEGAME-DIRECTORY, you will see like 25 backups.
- Pick the one, use the *modified date time* info to choose the latest backups before the hacker invaded you
- Rename the backup and restore it with the original name **DRAKS0005.sl2**, play again
- Remember to execute this backup-tool again

# I got hacked but I don't have Backups
- Sheeeeeeeet! :(
- Try to use your *Windows Shadow Copies* to restore an older backup
- Start using this tool now to avoid this happens again.
